    projDescription: `Medikall wasn't just another project for my portfolio presentation, it was a learning odyssey. As a software engineering student at the prestigious Alx Software Engineering Program (Foundation), I was eager to apply my newfound knowledge to a real-world project. Medikall became the perfect canvas to experiment, iterate, and push my boundaries.
    
    Having experienced first hand, how strenous it can be most times when visiting a clinic at most hospitals to book a consultation, I figured it might be a great idea to build something that can provide a solution to that problem. Something that can be refined into a product that offers convenience to patients and streamline consultation for doctors. While this is just an MVP, I hope to build on the App over time and who knows, it could be a profitable jumpstart for something big in the future of open source contributions from me.
